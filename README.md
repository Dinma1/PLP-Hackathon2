This is my second hackathon project.

This project is under the SDGs 4: Quality Education.
It is a site that helps to simplify complex topics for students, explaining terms to them as one can explain to a five-year old child.

Tools used:
Gemini AI
HTML
CSS
JAVASCRIPT
PYTHON

Gemini AI was used to create the prompts and lines of code.
HTML and CSS were used to design the body of the website.
JAVASCRIPT was used to make it work.
Python was used as the backend tool.

How it works:
Locate the search bar and input any topic you want to gain a simplified explanation.
Click on the button "Get Simple Explanation"
Then the result comes up.

Monetization:
There is a Pro version of this that gives a better explanation and is ads free.
We run ads on our platform which is a means to generate revenue.
When anyone clicks on our website, we generate money from there.
